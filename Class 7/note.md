Make sure that Node is installed on your computer before running the create-react-app command. You can download Node from nodejs.org: https://nodejs.org/.

If you have any npm errors during installation, run the following command in your terminal: npm install -g create-react-app. Then, use the npx create-react-app app-name command to create your app. Don't forget to move to the correct folder using the cd your-folder-name command.
