Today, we worked on a to-do list practice app and discussed the following topics:

Input tag: types 'number' and 'text', placeholders, and the 'onchange' function in input field.
Storing tasks using the 'useState' hook and utilizing the 'map' array method to display pending tasks.
Additionally, we learned about accessing 'event.target.value'.
