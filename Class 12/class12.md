Today, we discussed the following topics:
Revisiting Objects
Arrays & Array Methods like push(),slice(),map()
QA about concepts we have learned

Code we have written:
const students = ['anas', 'hassan', 'irfan']

console.log(students[0])

const students =  
 ["Anas", "Hassan", "Irfan",
"Hamza", {name:"Sufyan"}]

students.push("Bilal", "Awais", "Mubeen", "Basharat")

const academyStudents = students.slice(2, 4).map((acadS)=> acadS + " good")

console.log(academyStudents)
